# Hand-Pen
🖊 Hand Pen – AI-Based Virtual Drawing System  Hand Pen is a real-time AI-powered virtual drawing application that allows users to draw on the screen using hand gestures instead of a physical pen or mouse.

### how to use it:
1. allow camera access
2. **hold the SHIFT key** on your keyboard to start drawing ink (this is the trick to make it look clean without the ink dragging everywhere)
3. let go of shift to move your hand to the next letter
4. hit the spacebar if u mess up and want to clear the screen

feel free to mess around with the colors or the smoothing math.
